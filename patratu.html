    <h2>Patratu Valley & Dam</h2>
    <img src="pic/patratu.png" alt="patratu" width="700" height="500">
    <p>Forty kilometres outside Ranchi lies the scintillating Patratu Valley. With sparkling waters of the Patratu Dam on one side and lush green trees flanked along the other, driving along the Ghat of the Patratu Valley is truly a stupendous experience. However, do not venture into these roads after dark because of the rampant Naxalite influence in the area.</p>
    <p>The very magnificent Patratu Dam is the highlight of the Patratu Valley which stores the waters of the Nalkari River. Fascinatingly enough, the underground tunnel of the tunnel connected two villages near Patratu- Labga and Hariharpur, which was a thrilling route to travel in. But lately, due to security reasons, that route has been shut off. However, the dam is still one of the important tourist attractions where you can spot several fish in the rivers, watch the mesmerising sunrise and sunset</p>

    <p><b>Best time to visit:</b>Patratu Valley experiences hot summers and cold winters. Although any time of the year is ideal to visit the valley, as both summers and winters have a characteristic charm of their own, the valley is considered to be best visited between the months of October and March, when the temperature is moderate and the climate is pleasant.</p>
