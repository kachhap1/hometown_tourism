    <p>Surya Mandir or the Sun Temple in Ranchi is an elegantly designed modern temple. It is in the shape of a big chariot with eighteen wheels and seven lifelike horses that seem to be ready to take off into the sky. The Sun temple is situated about 39 km from Ranchi on Ranchi-Tata Road near Bundu. The temple provides a calm and peaceful environment with a pond in its complex. The pond is sacred to the Chhathavratis (devotees taking part in the Chhath Pooja) who believe that a dip in the pond will rid them of their sins</p>

    <p>Known for its unique architecture, the Surya Temple has become one of the most popular places to visit in Ranchi. Shaped like an 18-wheeled giant chariot driven by seven horses and surrounded by lush greenery, the temple is not just a sight to behold, but also an ideal spot to catch some downtime (because we all deserve a little breather).</p>

        Not to mention the intricate sculptures of Gods and Goddesses that add to its whimsical charm. It also sports a beautiful pond where you can take a dip before offering your prayers. A perfect example of the typical Sun Temple architecture, this hilltop temple is definitely worth a visit. Even the road that leads to the temple is picturesque, offering glimpses of the Chhota Nagpur Plateau region</p>
