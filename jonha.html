    <div><p>About 45 kms away from Ranchi situated on the Ranchi-Purulia Highway, is the Jonha Falls, named after the local village. It is also known as the Gautamdhara, as there is a temple dedicated to Lord Buddha, in its vicinity. The rocks here seem to beckon you down its natural gradient to join the frothy gurgling water of the River. The fall appears relatively more somber, enhancing the picturesque charm of the spot.</p>
