    <p>Built entirely from the rocks of Gonda Hill, Ranchiâ€™s Rock garden is complete in itself with waterfalls, sculptures, art and unrivaled views. Located on a small hill by the Kanke Dam, it is an impressive place to relax during your free time. Surrounded by lush greenery, the view from the garden is striking.  Do not miss out on the sunset that will surely leave you wanting for more! The small statues and sculpture scattered liberally across the Rock Garden also adds to its beauty.</p>

    <p>The main attraction, however, is the uniquely constructed iron footbridge which is supported only by two poles, a true example of architectural brilliance.If you are looking for some peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the city, grab a book and spend a few hours amidst the greenery here. If you are interested in knowing more about its history, you can even hire a guide who will take you through the garden</p>
